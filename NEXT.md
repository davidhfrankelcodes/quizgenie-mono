Now that you’ve got the core Go‐based API + worker code in place, here’s how I’d proceed:

1. **Spin up your local infrastructure and verify the API/worker**

   * Make sure Postgres and Redis are running (e.g. via Docker or locally).
   * Point your `backend/.env` (or environment variables) at that Postgres/Redis.
   * Run `go run ./cmd/api` and `go run ./cmd/worker` and exercise a simple “upload → quiz” cycle with `curl` or Postman:

     1. POST /signup → /login → get a JWT.
     2. POST /buckets (with a dummy file) → check that you see a new bucket in `/buckets` and a new file in `/buckets/{id}/files`.
     3. Wait for the worker to mark the file “completed” and rename the bucket.
     4. POST /buckets/{id}/quizzes → poll /quiz/{quizId} → fetch questions → submit an attempt → fetch attempt details.
        If all of those steps work end‐to‐end, your Go backend is solid.

2. **Hook up Docker (optional but recommended)**

   * Add a `docker-compose.yml` to bring up:

     * postgres:15
     * redis\:alpine
     * api (built from `cmd/api/Dockerfile`)
     * worker (built from `cmd/worker/Dockerfile`)
   * Mount a local folder for `FILE_STORAGE_PATH` so that the worker can process any uploaded file.
   * Once that’s done, you can run `docker-compose up --build` and repeat the same “upload → quiz” smoke test against [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), just to confirm everything works in containers.

3. **Implement actual file‐processing logic**
   Right now your worker is inserting a dummy question and immediately marking “ready.” The next step is to replace that stub with real PDF/text extraction + chunking + embeddings + bucket renaming:

   * Write a small `internal/utils/pdf.go` (or use an existing library) to read text from PDF.
   * In your Asynq `ProcessFile` handler, do:

     1. Read the uploaded file (detect “.pdf” vs. plain‐text).
     2. Extract text and break it into 2000-char chunks using `utils.ChunkText`.
     3. For each chunk, insert a `FileChunk` row and call `ai.GetEmbedding(chunk)` → store the 1536-vector.
     4. Once you’ve stored at least one embedding, call `ai.GenerateBucketName(firstFewChunks)` and update `buckets.name`.
     5. Mark `files.status = "completed"`.
   * Confirm that after uploading a real PDF, you see:

     * A new set of chunks in your `file_chunks` table (each with a non-nil embedding array).
     * Your bucket’s “(processing…)” name gets replaced by something meaningful.
     * Your file’s status updates to “completed.”

4. **Implement real quiz‐generation**
   Your current “GenerateQuiz” handler just sleeps and inserts a hard-coded question. Replace it with:

   1. Fetch all `file_chunks` for that bucket (only those from “completed” files).
   2. Run a simple sampling/selection of chunks (e.g. take all embeddings, pick a semantic pool via pgvector’s cosine distance or an in-Go approximation).
   3. Concatenate the text of the chosen chunks into a single `contextText`.
   4. Call `ai.GenerateQuestions(contextText, questionCount, choiceCount, difficulty)`, parse the returned JSON array into Go structs, and insert into `questions` and `answers` tables.
   5. Update `quizzes.status = "ready"`.
   6. Test by uploading a PDF containing actual content (e.g. a short chapter or article) and confirm that the backend writes a real, context-driven quiz.

5. **Start building the Angular frontend**
   Once your backend + worker can really:

   * Process a PDF → generate embeddings → rename the bucket
   * Generate a quiz from those chunks → store questions/answers in Postgres
     then you’re ready to wire up a basic SPA. In broad strokes:

   1. `ng new frontend` (with routing).
   2. Create an `AuthService` that hits `/signup` and `/login`, stores the JWT in `localStorage`, and adds the `Authorization` header on every request.
   3. Guard the routes so that anything except `/login` requires a valid JWT.
   4. Build a `BucketService` with:

      * `listBuckets(): GET /buckets`
      * `createBucket(file): POST /buckets` (multipart)
      * `listFiles(bucketId): GET /buckets/{bucketId}/files`
      * `pollFileStatus(...): GET /buckets/{bucketId}/files` every 5 sec
   5. Implement a `BucketListComponent` (on the left) that calls `listBuckets()` and shows each bucket name.
   6. Implement a `FileUploadComponent` that lets you pick a PDF and “create a new bucket,” then navigates to `/buckets/{newId}`.
   7. In `BucketDetailComponent` (`/buckets/:id`), show:

      * “The bucket name” (updated via AI after file processing)
      * A file list with status icons (pending/processing/completed/failed)
      * A “Take Quiz” button that is disabled until at least one file has `status === 'completed'`.
   8. When “Take Quiz” is clicked, pop up a small settings form (`PracticeMode`, `TimedMode`), then call `POST /buckets/{id}/quizzes`.
   9. Create a `QuizStatusComponent` (`/quizzes/:quizId/status`) that polls `GET /quizzes/{quizId}` until `status === 'ready'`, then navigates to `/quizzes/{quizId}/take`.
   10. Build a `QuizTakingComponent` that hits `GET /quizzes/{quizId}/questions`, renders each question/answers, collects choices, and on submit calls `POST /quizzes/{quizId}/attempts`.
   11. Show the report via a `QuizReportComponent` that calls `GET /attempts/{attemptId}`.
   12. Add a “History” view (`/buckets/{id}/history`) that calls `GET /buckets/{id}/attempts` and lists past attempts for that bucket.

6. **Iterate and polish**

   * Add proper loading spinners, error toasts, and form validation on the Angular side.
   * Style the sidebar so the active bucket tab is highlighted.
   * Make sure your Go handlers always return JSON errors (e.g. `{"error":"…"} status:400`) so the frontend can handle them gracefully.
   * Tweak your Docker Compose so you can bring up everything with a single `docker-compose up --build`.

–––

**In short:**

1. Verify your Go backend + worker end-to-end (upload dummy, quiz returns).
2. Replace the “stub” file/quiz logic with real PDF‐to‐text, chunking, embeddings, and AI‐powered quiz generation.
3. Once the backend can genuinely process a real PDF into a quiz, start scaffolding the Angular frontend step by step (authentication → bucket list → file upload → quiz workflow).
4. Finally, containerize everything via Docker Compose so that one command brings up Postgres, Redis, API, worker, and the Angular UI.

If you follow those steps in order, you’ll move from “proof-of-concept” to a fully functioning QuizGenie prototype. Good luck!
